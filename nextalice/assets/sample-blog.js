      <p>“I don’t want to be God’s rod towards anybody”.
      This is me ruminating to myself as I ponder on the subject of ‘brokenness’.</p>
      
      <p>“I cherish my broken moments. They are precious to me.They are precious to Jesus. They are  landmarks  in my walk with Jesus. I love them. I don’t despise process. I don’t despise shaping. And if it is pain that will make me yield more to God, so be it”</p>
      I wrote…<br>
      <br>
      <p>I was listening to a song by Ps Godswill Oyor. The song relays surrender and brokenness. I recall I chanced on that song during a nadir in life. Few times when I am devastated, I will revert to the song and I will experience life piercing into the corridors of my heart. That song has been my life support in broken times. </p>
      <br>

      <p>As I revisited the song this time around, I was not broken. I was just sober. 
      Howbeit, the song flooded my heart with memories. The incidence that led to my brokenness. And how those situations have configured my person. I am grateful to God, I am grateful to the quagmire and I am grateful to all those involved.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But.. I found myself say, “ I don’t want to be God’s rod towards anyone" </p>

      <p>Spare the rod, spoil the child right? 
      The Bible says those God receives as sons, He will chastise them. We cannot elude process . Few times, God will use His rod on us. At the end of process, we are more refined and malleable in His hands. 
      That is when we become vessels worthy for His use.
      “For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives.””
      Hebrews 12:6 NKJV </p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Thus, no one called unto the path of consecration  will escape process. 
      By process I mean, the school of the Spirit. In the school of the Spirit, the curriculum is the same but the syllabus may be individualized. Once you are called into sonship, you won’t escape this. This is the making of Sons. We must be made, so that we can be given. 
      “For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given.”
      Isaiah 9:6a NKJV </p>
      <br>

      <p>This is to say that, God’s rod, is expedient to our profiting in the Kingdom. 
      Because only sons profit the Kingdom. 
      Being a child benefits you, being a son benefits the Kingdom.
      “Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,”Galatians 4:1NKJV </p>
      <br>

      <p>God’s rod can be anything. 
      They are mostly circumstances orchestrated by God to shape us. Having established the necessity of God to use His rod on his children which can be excruciating. Let’s talk about people who can pose as God’s rod.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Though we have been called into sonship and thus will be chastised by the rod of discipline. It is not right for anyone to pose as that rod. There are some unfair situations some people will subject others to, which in the long run, mould the victims because all things work together for good, but God doesn’t need help in chastising and making His sons.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>David must be King. Ineluctably, David would still have gone through the process. I mean He was not ascending the throne ‘a boy’ God had to make him into a man. But was Saul’s part necessary? David can be King without anyone posing as Saul. He could go through process without being a fugitive; without anyone taunting his life day and night. The process itself is painful, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be more painful. Don’t be a  Saul to any David.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God is resourceful and inventive. He doesn’t waste experiences. And so all things will work together for our good. But frankly, some things that fit into the all, can be circumvented. </p>
      

      <p>We don’t need people to teach us lessons when the Holy Spirit can teach us. The Holy Spirit is the best teacher, not experiences, not man- orchestrated circumstances. 
      The lessons from people leave us with scars. Scars that can lead to Ashermans syndrome. You don’t need the lessons that will override you with guilt and shame such that you can’t accept God’s opportunities in future or make you lose hope in humanity and genuine people.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God will use His rod on us which will cause pain. Allow God deploy His rod unescorted by you. 
      People must learn that vain is the trust of men, but your betrayal should not be the conduit.
      Joseph would have still gone to Egypt, endure process and become prime minister nonetheless must going to Egypt be on the premise of his brothers’ betrayal? </p>
      <br>

      <p>You don’t have to be the source of someone’s pain for the person to learn surrender. Don’t indoctrinate people with grief for them to run to God. Allow God chastise His children by Himself. </p>

      <p>“Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.”
      Galatians 6:10 NKJV.</p>

    content:`
      <p>Decisions and consequences are like the two sides of a coin; you flip one and have the other. One cannot escape decision making. Even indecision makes a decision itself. Decision making is part of life, of necessity; growth. Same with consequences; no one can escape consequences.</p><br>

      <p>Normally, when we hear of informed decision, what comes to mind is a decision that has been thoroughly considered on all fronts.</p>

      <p>You do a risk-benefit assessment and take a decision that will profit you.</p><br>

      <p>In the secular world, there are parameters of assessment, for example, which opportunity offers better remuneration, which prospective partner looks promising, which location presents greener pasture etc.
      These are the cannons of assessment for the mundane.</p><br>

      <p>But it is not the same with the believer. For the believer, informed decision is that which one has been led by the Spirit to do. So no matter the number of attractive options presented to you, the best choice is the one the Holy Spirit leads toward.</p><br>

      <p>You will realize one would be asked to sleep on a choice then come up with the final decision, eg signing a new contract, switching jobs, relocating etc.</p><br>

      <p>There is no need to think through what you are being led to do by the Spirit if it is a good decision or not.</p>

      <p>Every instruction by God is a good advice, thus good decision.

      Thus any step taken in response to God is the right step.Unless you are not sure it is the Spirit of God leading you, then you should wait on the LORD for clarity.</p><br>

      <p>But once you get the clarity that, this is the leading of God, there is no need to have second thoughts, what the Spirit is leading you to, is the informed decision.</p><br>

      <p>Since we cannot escape decision making, we cannot escape reaping the consequences. As long as there is seed time and harvest, God cannot be mocked. We reap the consequences of our inactions, even indecisions. There is no way one can escape consequences. Therefore consider every decision with the spirit. Submit your ways to God and he shall prosper you.</p><br>

      <p>You may be phlegmatic, who may have difficulty in arriving at a decision, a melancholy, very analytic or even a sanguine who may ignore small details, whatever your temperament is, you are first a believer, thus don’t leave God out of your decision-making processes.</p><br>

      <p>God wants to lead you. He will not be silent if you need His opinion about ANYTHING. God always has an opinion, if only you will ask Him. And after you inquire and He leads, do not question it, even if it doesn’t appeal to human logic. Even if it doesn’t look like the best option according to human standards.</p>

      <p>It is not wise to question the one who is wisdom. Do not lean on your own understanding.</p><br>

      <p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.”<br>
      Proverbs 3:5-6NKJV</p><br>

      <p>“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”<br>
      Romans 8:14 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.”<br>
      Jeremiah 29:11 NKJV</p><br>

    author: "Alice Anane Tawiah",
    date: "2025-05-04",
    content: `
      <p>Apostle Arome Osayi has a powerful exhortation titled “ What will you do with the Holy Ghost?”</p><br>
      <p>You should listen, it talks about how the believer makes use of the precious Gift that the Holy Spirit is.</p><br>
      <p>Myles Monroe says when the purpose of anything is not known, abuse is inevitable.</p><br>
      <p>Assuming your father has made you the heir to a Goldmine and you don’t know how valuable Gold is. You will farm on the land instead of mining for Gold.</p><br>
      <p>What will you do with the Holy Ghost? This is a question God can ask us. After giving us such advantage, how will we make use of it?</p><br>
      <p>What will you do with this mistake?, is a question some of us too can ask God.</p><br>
      <p>Beauty for ashes, right?</p><br>
      <p>This is not a burning ruin, this is the ashes of the ruin, the most useless spoil of a destruction. What can possibly come out of an ash? Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Nathaniel will ask, like his friend rightly answered, “come and see”.</p><br>
      <p>John C Maxwel has a book titled, ‘ FAILING FORWARD’. I love it, it talks about how one can use mistakes as stepping stones to purpose. May your mistake minister restoration to others, that you failed forward like John C. Maxwell will say.</p><br>
      <p>I made a mistake, and realizing the gravity of my actions, I attempted to correct it. But I realized the person I stabbed is already dead. Oh my..what can I do now? She is dead already, no matter how sorry I am, she can’t come back to life. And the one who is called resurrection smiled at me. He told me “ It seems you have forgotten my name, I am the resurrection and life “</p><br>
      <p>Through faith, women received their dead back to life but the women didn’t raise the dead themselves, the one who is called resurrection did.</p><br>
      <p>And so resurrection told me, “you can receive her back to life but not by you preforming incessant CPR, just give me the corpse”</p><br>
      <p>And I asked Him, “ I know that all things work together for good, please, how will my murder work for her good? she’s gone as you can see”</p><br>
      <p>Resurrection told me “ come and see”</p><br>
      <p>He took the lifeless body, He took my mistake, He took the ashes of my damage and He entered His incubation chamber.</p><br>
      <p>Give it to Him. Give Him the pain. Give Him the guilt. Give Him the ruins of your mistake. And if the guilt is too much, He can help you get through it. But give Him the burden. And it’s okay to ask “ What will He do with this mistake?”</p><br>
      <p>Well, I don’t have all the answers but I know one, Beauty….i know when we give Him an ash, He gives us petals. He is an expert in turning the most ugliest circumstances into wonders, beauties to behold.</p><br>
      <p>This mistake is woeful, it seems you can’t do anything to redeem it. Oh but He is redeemer of my past. I don’t have to attempt to go back to correct things, I may make matters worse. But, I can hand over the mistake to Him.</p><br>
      <p>We are asking God, what can He possibly do with this irreversible damage you have caused. Can any good thing come out of this mistake if not pain, shame and regret?</p><br>
      <p>Unlike us, God knows the ‘purpose’ of that mistake and He won’t abuse it and so he beckons on us “ come and see”</p><br>
      <p>He knows exactly what He will do  with the mistake.</p><br>
      <p>“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”</p><br>
      <p>Romans 8:28 NKJV</p><br>
      <p>“A bruised reed He will not break, And smoking flax He will not quench; He will bring forth justice for truth.”</p><br>
      <p>Isaiah 42:3 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>The weight of self is the most difficult to shed. When you are your own distraction. When there is a will to be with Him but it seems faint. Now your audience is you, to please you.</p><br>
    <p>But I thought you said you love Him more than anything?</p><br>
    <p>Now when we say we love Him more than anything, externals come to mind, third parties come to mind. But what about me?</p><br>
    <p>Do I love Him more than me?</p><br>
    <p>Do I love Him more than what I want?</p><br>
    <p>I have heard of self-abandonment. Yes..He mentioned that if I want to follow Him, I should deny myself. Now the enemy between me and Him is me. It’s either Him or me.</p><br>
    <p>Wills and assurances..what’s the point of Him giving us will of not to willingly choose Him? He also needs assurance yes, that we choose Him without compulsion. We choose Him without threats.</p><br>
    <p>I can’t love me and love Him. I can’t be enthroned on my heart and say He is my King. Only Him rules. Only His name is Glorified. So I let go of any weight and entanglement, even if the weight is me, that I may win Him.</p><br>

    content: `
    <p>The first thing that came to mind when the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart about this was “WASTING ON PLEASURE”.</p><br>
    <p>One wise man said, if a man loses touch with purpose, He distracts himself with pleasure. This cannot be more true.</p><br>
    <p>The devil…No wonder he is called the old serpent, is very cunning. But thanks be to God the ancient of days, is on our side, always exposing his devices.</p><br>
    <p>The devil is not really interested in you serving Him, so far as you won’t serve the purposes of God. If He can get you to serve yourself, He is good to go.</p><br>
    <p>And He does this with a bait called pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>His manifesto doesn’t applaud his own government, He rather recommends self-government. He prompts you on how much you can be in charge of your own life, how that you deserve that enjoyment, how that you should give yourself a break and sleep, how that just one movie wouldn’t hurt. He convinces you that there is enough time, and that you can use the time at hand to please yourself. He convinces you to put yourself ahead of what God wants you to do. And so the time you are to interceed, you will be surfing the internet, the time you are to read the word, you will be on WhatsApp. Because it is easier and more appealing to the flesh and so we service that one instead of God’s needs.</p><br>
    <p>But…what about our first love?</p><br>
    <p>Love…Love is sweet. Love is warm. Love is life but most importantly, love is demanding. Love comes with responsibility that’s why it’s a choice.</p><br>
    <p>There are times in our love walk with the King that you cannot wait to be in the room alone with Him, where you lavish all that you are on Him. Where every word in His voice sends vibrations to your spines, where He is the only one who can move you. These are beautiful seasons in our walk with Him that when He draws us, it is easy to run after Him. In these seasons, we are not afraid to say there is nothing we won’t give up for Him.</p><br>
    <p>However, there come seasons that the tunes we dance to become silent. Such that the chords we respond to will be the knowing in our hearts. Where conviction will be our only drive. The tunes that served as the wave that swept us to His chambers seemed to have dried out. So we have to willingly push ourselves to His presence.</p><br>
    <p>During this season, the voice of the flesh becomes loud because the tunes of the King’s love song seem to have gone dim. It is during this season that if care is not taken, pleasure will be the new King.</p><br>
    <p>But that is not how love is done. We don’t only love when the sensations are loud. We love even when everywhere is quiet and the chirping of birds have died out.</p><br>
    <p>It is not easy to read the word consistently, and sometimes, it is not sweet to pray. But if we are always looking for sweet before we commit, we will sell ourselves to the colony of pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>And so He asked Peter, do you love me more than these?</p><br>
    <p>Do you love me more than pleasure?</p><br>
    <p>And pleasure can be a person, a movie, even a meal. Do you love Him more than these?</p><br>
    <p>Don’t waste away on pleasure. Don’t be a slave to pleasure, sacrificing your destiny on the altar of fleeting pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>Ever wonder why you no longer feel the burden God gave you? You kept on procrastinating and now another has taken your place. You feel entitled to another chance so you relegate what you can do now to tomorrow because you feel pleasure is more urgent than God’s needs.</p><br>
    <p>Everyone has potential to be great if only you will partner with God instead of pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>Yes, the dopamine rush when you surf the internet is out of this world but what about your commitment to your personal altar? What about your destiny? What about your generation? Most importantly, what about the one you love?</p><br>
    <p>And so He asks, Do you love Him more than the dopamine rush?</p><br>
    <p>This is a wake up call to all of us, let us return to the secret place.</p><br>
    <p>“Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.”<br>
    Revelation 2:4-5 KJV</p><br>
    <p>“He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.”<br>

    content: `
    <p>Regrets… I know we all have regrets.<br>
    Regret can spring from many channels. Predominately, from wrong decisions. We can regret ignoring our intuition, trusting the wrong person, investing in a wrong venture. Mostly, we regret we’ve been victimized by people and circumstances. When people you trust betray you.<br>
    Per the aforementioned circumstances, regret seems inevitable.<br>
    <br>
    
    However, what if you are rather the villain in the story? This is a different ball game altogether. It’s one thing to have regrets because you are the victim of circumstances, it’s another thing to have regrets because you are the perpetrator of evil.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“I killed my sister”…… I used to tell myself this. “How could I? She needed me and if I couldn’t be there for her, I shouldn’t have murdered her”.<br>
    This is me in my lowest moment in life. I was beaten by guilt and I had given up, made the muddy waters my home.<br>
    <br>
    Have you ever made such a terrible mistake such that you write yourself off? Your mistake has become a scar such that whenever any opportunity comes up, you tell yourself you don’t deserve it?<br>
    Past experiences can block present day opportunities, yes. Only if we allow it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let’s talk about Asherman’s syndrome.<br>
    This is a medical term for a scar in the uterus that prevents conception from reaching its full term. This scar may have occurred in the past as a result of a surgical procedure in the womb (D and C) for elective abortion, incomplete miscarriage or retained placenta after delivery. Apart from elective abortion, the conditions that necessitate this procedure are things one does not have control of and must undergo to ensure continuity and safety of life.<br>
    <br>
    Of all the reasons for this procedure, let’s talk about elective abortion. Remember, I said it’s a scar in the womb that prevents pregnancy. Elective abortion is a procedure one willingly opts for. So after your own decision has left you with a forever scar such that future opportunities seem to have been blocked.<br>
    <br>
    So I prefer to synonymize Asherman’s syndrome to the weight of guilt that prevents new beginnings.<br>
    There is a difference between regret and repentance. Regret births guilt whereas repentance births restitution.<br>
    <br>
    Guilt makes you see yourself below how God does. You will feel undeserving of any good thing. It is this scar that prevents future opportunities, future pregnancies such that you miscarry any new conception.</p>
    <br>

    <p>There are indelible marks in the heart.<br>
    Marks that have been infected.<br>
    We attempt debridement, but the more we scrape off the infected flesh, the more we realize amputation is a better option.<br>
    This is because the wound is directing the treatment plan.<br>
    <br>
    But… there is a Physician I know, whose treatment plan is not dependent on the size of the wound of the patient, but His own wound. He is called the Balm of Gilead.<br>
    Through His own wounds, we receive healing.<br>
    If your heart is butchered beyond recovery, He can give you a new heart.<br>
    “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”<br>
    Ezekiel 36:26 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>He told me His recreative healing will take place and those who are willing, He will give a new heart. And not just a new heart, but a new beginning. He will speak life to your paths and decorate your paths with mercy. Your paths will breathe with newness. The past is not as essential as you make it seem. He told me it is not wisdom to hold on to a second when you have eternity ahead of you. What is behind you is just but a second, don’t rob yourself of the vast future ahead of you.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Ever wonder why is it rather the GOODNESS of God that leads to repentance, not His wrath?<br>
    Don’t excuse yourself from Grace because the Perfect One Himself has a different prescription. 
    <br>
    <br>He doesn’t write you off to teach you a lesson, He rather infuses you with overdose of love to bring you back home. That’s why when the world was so depraved with sin, His solution was LOVE.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“For God so loved the world…”<br>
    Sounds familiar?</p>
    <br>

    <p>So you are holding back, not receiving His love and new opportunities He is giving because of guilt. Guilt is weighty. Guilt is very heavy. And most importantly, it’s an indicator of pride. For when God gives you a seat and you say you don’t deserve it, you are proud. Says my Father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah.
    <br>
    <br>
     The LORD has been teaching me about pride. Pride is to set yourself in opposition to God. That’s why He opposes the proud. But the proud sets himself before the LORD first. So if God is saying you are worthy of this Gift and you have a different opinion, you have set yourself in opposition and you are proud. God says you are forgiven and you are refusing to forgive yourself, you are not on the same page with God.<br>
     <br>
    Another thing He told me about pride is that, anyone who is proud will not bend enough to be covered. To be covered by what? His Grace. That’s why He gives Grace to the humble but He resists the proud. He resists the proud in that the proud wants to rub shoulders with Him, not lowly enough to receive Grace. 
    <br>
    <br>You cannot be covered by Grace, you cannot be covered by His love. So you need to stop resisting His love in the name of “I don’t deserve it.” In the name of guilt, you are setting yourself in opposition to God. Mercy…</p>
    <br>

    <p>Guilt will keep you stuck, you cannot fly as the eagle you are. Whereas you belong to the sky, the weight of guilt will cripple you on ground. For no one can fly with a weight.</p>

    <br>
    <p>That’s why He asked us to lay aside every weight so that we will be able to run…</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,”<br>
    Hebrews 12:1 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whatever the weight of that guilt is, you can exchange it for His yoke. His yoke is not as heavy as the guilt. And so He says, come and Rest.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”<br>
    Matthew 11:28-30 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>You don’t have to hold on to that pain. Just allow His gentle touch. And that guilt of a scar that is preventing new conceptions, just like Asherman’s syndrome—He can heal it. One thing about God is that He is the only one who can heal a wound without leaving a scar. There will not be any trace of it. Only if you will allow Him.</p>
    <br>

    <p>And so, He is calling unto the mighty woman within you. Don’t shield her with your old identity. He is calling unto the Apostle in you. Who are you to say you are not worthy? You are not wiser than God. You are the perfectionist, not Him. He is the perfect one. You don’t have to have a clean history to have a beautiful future. Allow God…</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whatever Gold He is calling out of you, don’t question His intelligence. Heaven is waiting on you. Your generation awaits you. Wake up. Shake off the dust. Step out of the darkness of shame. Pick up your mat and walk, General. The cloud of witnesses cheers you on.</p>
    <br>

    <p>If God says I am worthy of forgiveness, then I agree with Him. You should also come into agreement with what Heaven has declared over your life.<br>
    <br>
    The goodness of God leads to repentance, not the wrath of God.<br>
    Because of His mercies, we are not consumed, all of us. No one can outgrow mercy.</p>
    <br>

    <p>You are welcome back Home, Precious one.<br>
    <br>
    By God’s Grace,<br>

      <p>“I’m not going anywhere, I will be here.”<br>
      <br>
      This is what I have been telling Him. This is because my allegiance to Him is being challenged.<br>
      A friend of mine said, every believer will come to a point where it seems one is losing faith, but we must ensure our faith doesn’t fail.<br>
      <br>
      My Father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah says faith failure is worse than heart failure. Even in my struggle of keeping my own faith, I’ve been thinking about this and it can’t be more true, because the just shall live by Faith and without faith, the righteous dies. Abraham was righteous because He had faith, thus the righteous is nought, without faith.</p>
      <br>

      <p>The path of the righteous is as a shining light, yes, it shines brighter and brighter unto a perfect day. Howbeit, on this path are mountains, valleys, crooked paths and rough edges. There are valley seasons and mountain seasons, regardless of whatever season you are in, one thing is sure, your path shines, because His word lights your path.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve been in my valley season, and faith doesn’t make sense, faith doesn’t appeal to reason, yes, but in this season, I was siding with logic and reason. I started to question my ventilator, my life support, my belief system. Everything seemed like a cliché to me. I was dying because I was losing faith, remember, the just shall live by faith.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p><strong>THE COMPANY OF LOVE</strong><br>
      1 Corinthians 13 makes more sense here, it says Love never fails. Even when it seems faith is failing, love will sustain it.<br>
      <br>
      Follow me…</p>
      <br>

      <p>In my darkest moment when I was thinking of the unthinkable, I was doubting the existence of the one who holds existence together. My faith was practically gone, I thought that was it, and the company of love showed up.<br>
      <br>
      I didn’t know one could hotspot on someone’s faith. Like, I’m running out of battery and I needed to key in to someone’s reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      Speaking with a member of the company of love, the idea of ‘hotspotting’ someone’s faith came to mind. Because He was feeding me His faith and I was gaining strength.<br>
      Today, I want to appreciate my company of love.<br>
      <br>
      I was ashamed that I was going through what I am going through. I was angry that, how can I be doubting and questioning God. Then my company showed up and told me to rest, stop beating myself up, I should lie down while they infuse me with love. Because love is the answer to any question of faith.<br>
      <br>
      One such instance, I had to pray with one member, when he called, I told him it was pointless because I don’t believe anyway. He told me to be on the phone and not say anything, just hear him pray and that was life giving.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God has been lavish when it comes to His provision of love, in that He has given me people who will love me well. It is because of them I didn’t lose faith, because when my own faith was failing, their love didn’t fail and I could hear Abbah’s voice through their love.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I want to first of all appreciate one of my greatest Gifts, my mother. I would have said I don’t deserve her but my father in the LORD has made me know when God offers you a seat and you say you don’t deserve it, that’s not humility but pride. So I accept and appreciate the gift of you, Mama Doe. God was so intentional when He gave me you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I appreciate my father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah. I first had the privilege of calling someone Dad because of you. You are right for me. You are the best Abbah could ever give. I love and honor you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>My sister, TillyJoy, you love me to a fault, you feel my pain like it’s yours. You could pluck your eyes for me when I’m struggling to see. I see you, I hear your heart and I appreciate you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>My brother, Prince Israel, I call you the LORD’s. There is nothing you won’t do for me. You will go high and low for me. I love you as much as you do. You are my best gift from God. I love your heart, you are rare.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I used to trivialize the gift of friends so I lost valuable people, irreplaceable. I am not going to make the same mistake again. Friends make the journey easier, they bear your yoke with you, they make the burden lighter.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, I am going to be intentional in appreciating them, I’m going to be mentioning names.</p>

      <p><strong>Shekinah Glory</strong>, you’ve been like a cushion to my life’s storms. When I am afraid and trembling, you’ve been the voice of Abbah, telling me to fear not. You are so wise and beautiful. I am lucky to have you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Theo</strong>, I call you Man of Jesus Christ. I can count on you always. At gun point, when I’m asked to call one person, it would be you. You are always there for me, in and out of season. I can’t thank God enough for you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Kharis</strong>, you are Greatness personified. You know me through and through and you are not ashamed to love me recklessly. You are unconventional, sacrificial and beautiful. Thank you for you. You are Gold.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Jedi</strong>, my brother. You are comfort, you are peace, you are full of life. You fit in so well and you do the brother role perfectly. Thank you for loving me. I am honored.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Percy</strong>, thank you for hearing me when I can’t find my voice. You can read my heart when my voice fails. Thank you for being here. I’m grateful for you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Becky</strong>, thank you for being honest, straightforward and wise. Thank you for having my back. You care and I appreciate it.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Maame K</strong>, you are sweet as your name. My sweet Ama. You challenge me. You make me want to be better. You are beautiful and even more beautiful at heart. I’m glad that I am your best friend. I love you so much.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Shofar</strong>, my sister in destiny. You are very prompt and intentional about me. Thank you for hearing me out when I need you. You shine so bright and your light blesses my world.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Diana</strong>, it’s been more than a decade and you are still here, loving on me. Your love is true. Your love has stood the test of time. I know I mean a lot to you and you are also archived in my heart.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I am able to tell Abbah that I will be here, I am not leaving because these people did not leave me when I betrayed my own self, when I was sabotaging myself they restrained me by their love. When I couldn’t pray, they were praying for me. And because of them, I have a reason to live and fulfill purpose.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Happy birthday to me, I am because of you.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <br>

    <p>He who waters shall be watered. This principle works so much for me. When I share myself, I increase the more. And that is why I am going to be open and vulnerable in this piece. And just like you, I hope I am as blessed by the end of this piece.</p>

    <p>May Jesus be our light and life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I found myself in a vicious cycle. Whenever I hear “out of Egypt forever,” my heart leaps.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Like, I’ve longed for the entanglements of the flesh that kept me in Egypt to loose.</p>

    <p>Lust was my number one enemy. I am a heart person. I long for affection and closeness. Mostly, I desire to express my fondness through harmless touches, male and female alike.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Same way, I love intimacy. Intimacy is good but it can be corrupted. So I would find myself in this web. But finally, I won the battle against lust. I let go of all the triggers. If it is a relationship that created that ambience for lust to thrive, I gave it up.</p>
    <br>
   

    <p><strong>KAIROS MOMENTS</strong></p>

    <p>Now I had realized some things about seasons. It seemed whenever I am at the verge of breakthrough, I would mess up and lose that opportunity. These are sponsored by time-sensitive demonic watchers. Just like the man by the pool of Bethesda, there are kairos moments that angels come to stir up waters. Such destiny-altering moments require promptness, sensitivity at its peak, and utmost alignment — else one will remain stagnant while prophecies hang over your shoulders.</p>
    <br>

    <p>So realizing this, I decided to honor my destiny by sitting up. I fought against lust when it came at that time of the month. At last, I won.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I knew it. I saw it. I saw it fleeing from me. I knew it was done.</p>

    <p><em>“Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.”</em><br>
    James 4:7 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>I thought that was it — that which used to be a stumbling block had been done away with. I saw glimpses of glory. I went back to the chambers of the King. I dined with Him. I danced for Him. He is worthy of my heart, my all. I was now expecting the promise — nothing would stand in the way now.</p>
    <br>

    <p>But…</p>

    <p>Another enemy surfaced: offense. After I realized the warfare I was in, I asked myself why I am constantly fighting these frontline demons — lust, offense, pride, fear, etc.</p>
    <br>

    <p>This time round, I found myself battling with offense (unforgiveness). I had been betrayed by my best friend, and I couldn’t reason my way into forgiveness. Because I knew I could never do the same to him. Honor would not permit me to. Love would not permit me. Compassion would not permit me. So how could he?</p>
    <br>

    <p>I contemplated forgiveness while I kept on asking: Why? Why did he? So, I felt unforgiveness was my leverage over him. If I don’t forgive, it will mean he still owes me and he’s caught within my claws. I wanted to forgive. At the same time, I didn’t want to.</p>
    <br>

    <p>One day, I woke up with anger in my heart, coupled with an ache. I was hurt and bruised, still contemplating forgiveness, and then the gentle whispers of the Helper came through…</p>
    <br>

    <p>He asked rhetorically, “Do you know you are under attack?”</p>
    <br>

    <p>That question opened my eyes to all that was happening around me. The devil was trying to short-circuit the promise I had been waiting for, by using offense — his bait. I fell for it. Lust was gone. Now, he was using offense. That being realized, I prayed and released whoever I needed to release — and consequently, released myself from the prison of offense. Then the sweet Holy Spirit continued…</p>
    <br>

    <p>“You cannot reason your way into forgiveness, neither can you lessen the weight of guilt through reason. Reasoning makes it worse. It buttresses why you should not let it go. But just as it didn’t make sense when God decided to die for you, so does forgiving the unforgivable. God was unreasonably merciful, unreasonably forgiving, unreasonably gracious. He saw that it was your fault — truly He did see — but He forgave you.”</p>
    <br>

    <p>Then I forgave them. And I forgave me. I felt light. Handcuffs removed. I am free to access my lot.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Wow!</p>
    <br>

    <p>Offense gone. Gone for good. Satan does not have anything with me anymore, and I decided that I will be on guard by guarding my heart. I will not be ignorant of the devices of the enemy.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.”</em><br>
    2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whenever anything ungodly attempts to enter my heart, I arrest it at the gate. I man the gate of my heart. It is my responsibility.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.”</em><br>
    Proverbs 4:23 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>So now, I am on the watch for any scheme of the enemy. It will not catch me at the blind side — not anymore.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Then, boredom set in…</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>LETHARGY WHEN BUSINESS IS REQUIRED</strong></p>

    <p>I had been praying all manner of prayers, fasted all kinds of fasting for this promise. Now, by the grace of God, I had bypassed time-sensitive bumps that could lead to detours. Here it was — at hand, the promise. Within arm’s reach. And what did I do?</p>
    <br>

    <p>No, I didn’t sleep. Neither did I default into the old ways. I got distracted. I was not ensnared by sin this time — I was trapped by apathy.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Prayer became so hard. My mouth became heavy. All I could do was entertain myself with intellectual movies and maybe games. They’re not sinful, right? But I was missing out on kairos — the season I had been waiting for.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Having done all to stand, stand.”</p>

    <p>If all the machinations of the devil fail, he will use you against you. That’s what he did with me.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I felt I needed a break from God. Funny, right?</p>

    <p>I invested my emotions to pray all these prayers, do all He asked me, and the wait was killing me. So I said, “You know what? Let me take a break. I will only watch movies.”</p>
    <br>

    <p>I termed it self-care. Interestingly, that was when the promise arrived. He knocked and knocked — my order was in — but I was engrossed in the movies, engrossed with self-care. Engrossed, paying attention to me. I really did pay.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore…”</em><br>
    Ephesians 6:13–14a NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>When you read from the first verse of the chapter, Apostle Paul addresses various kinds of relationships. He addresses offense and prescribes love.</p>
    <br>

    <p>So after one has fought offense and the likes — just like I did — we must still STAND.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Having done all to stand, stand again.</strong></p>

    <p>Perry Stone authored a book I’m drawn to: *“There is a Crack in Your Armor.”*</p>

    <p>There are things that do not directly come against us, but weaken our resolve.</p>
    <br>

    <p>My armor was in place. I wasn’t harboring offense, lust, or anything. But there was a crack. I had lost focus.</p>

    <p>The enemy may offer you water and a tent to rest from the race.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“...and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,”</em><br>
    Hebrews 12:1c NKJV</p>

    <p>That is what he offered me. I took a break from God. But the race requires steady, consistent progress. Speed is not necessary. Steadiness is. And in this race, we don’t take breaks. No, we don’t.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE FERTILE SEASONS</strong></p>

    <p>Fertile seasons don’t just surface. They represent years of spiritual investment — prayers, seed sowing, fasting in response to God’s instructions.</p>
    <br>

    <p>These are fruitful seasons where the least effort brings huge results. They come after seasons of dry toiling. You don’t have to toil anymore — just one push and it’s done.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Like Elijah praying for rain — and no sign — then that one last word of prayer released the rain. A fertile season is the culmination of all previous efforts.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Ironically, it’s during these seasons that it’s hardest to open your mouth. That one last push becomes the heaviest. You could pray for hours during dry seasons, but now… you can’t whisper a word. That’s lethargy in a fertile season.</p>
    <br>

    <p>When you feel inertia and apathy in prayer, you may be in your fertile season. Attractive distractions will come. When this happens — call for reinforcement. A friend. An online service. Anything. Just speak that one word. That’s all it takes to release the rain.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Having done all to stand in dry seasons — STAND in your fertile season.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>PRAYER</strong></p>

    <p>I pray for you, that you will not become lethargic in your fertile season. That you will be sensitive enough to recognize your kairos.</p>
    <br>

    <p>And if you have missed out on a fertile season, I pray for mercy for restoration.</p>
    <br>

    <p>God can repeat seasons by His mercies.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I pray this write-up accomplishes God’s desire in our lives, in Jesus’ name.</p>
    <br>

    <p>If you are blessed, kindly leave a comment. It encourages me.</p>
