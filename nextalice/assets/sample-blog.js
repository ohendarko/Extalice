      <p>“I don’t want to be God’s rod towards anybody”.
      This is me ruminating to myself as I ponder on the subject of ‘brokenness’.</p>
      
      <p>“I cherish my broken moments. They are precious to me.They are precious to Jesus. They are  landmarks  in my walk with Jesus. I love them. I don’t despise process. I don’t despise shaping. And if it is pain that will make me yield more to God, so be it”</p>
      I wrote…<br>
      <br>
      <p>I was listening to a song by Ps Godswill Oyor. The song relays surrender and brokenness. I recall I chanced on that song during a nadir in life. Few times when I am devastated, I will revert to the song and I will experience life piercing into the corridors of my heart. That song has been my life support in broken times. </p>
      <br>

      <p>As I revisited the song this time around, I was not broken. I was just sober. 
      Howbeit, the song flooded my heart with memories. The incidence that led to my brokenness. And how those situations have configured my person. I am grateful to God, I am grateful to the quagmire and I am grateful to all those involved.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But.. I found myself say, “ I don’t want to be God’s rod towards anyone" </p>

      <p>Spare the rod, spoil the child right? 
      The Bible says those God receives as sons, He will chastise them. We cannot elude process . Few times, God will use His rod on us. At the end of process, we are more refined and malleable in His hands. 
      That is when we become vessels worthy for His use.
      “For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives.””
      Hebrews 12:6 NKJV </p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Thus, no one called unto the path of consecration  will escape process. 
      By process I mean, the school of the Spirit. In the school of the Spirit, the curriculum is the same but the syllabus may be individualized. Once you are called into sonship, you won’t escape this. This is the making of Sons. We must be made, so that we can be given. 
      “For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given.”
      Isaiah 9:6a NKJV </p>
      <br>

      <p>This is to say that, God’s rod, is expedient to our profiting in the Kingdom. 
      Because only sons profit the Kingdom. 
      Being a child benefits you, being a son benefits the Kingdom.
      “Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,”Galatians 4:1NKJV </p>
      <br>

      <p>God’s rod can be anything. 
      They are mostly circumstances orchestrated by God to shape us. Having established the necessity of God to use His rod on his children which can be excruciating. Let’s talk about people who can pose as God’s rod.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Though we have been called into sonship and thus will be chastised by the rod of discipline. It is not right for anyone to pose as that rod. There are some unfair situations some people will subject others to, which in the long run, mould the victims because all things work together for good, but God doesn’t need help in chastising and making His sons.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>David must be King. Ineluctably, David would still have gone through the process. I mean He was not ascending the throne ‘a boy’ God had to make him into a man. But was Saul’s part necessary? David can be King without anyone posing as Saul. He could go through process without being a fugitive; without anyone taunting his life day and night. The process itself is painful, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be more painful. Don’t be a  Saul to any David.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God is resourceful and inventive. He doesn’t waste experiences. And so all things will work together for our good. But frankly, some things that fit into the all, can be circumvented. </p>
      

      <p>We don’t need people to teach us lessons when the Holy Spirit can teach us. The Holy Spirit is the best teacher, not experiences, not man- orchestrated circumstances. 
      The lessons from people leave us with scars. Scars that can lead to Ashermans syndrome. You don’t need the lessons that will override you with guilt and shame such that you can’t accept God’s opportunities in future or make you lose hope in humanity and genuine people.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God will use His rod on us which will cause pain. Allow God deploy His rod unescorted by you. 
      People must learn that vain is the trust of men, but your betrayal should not be the conduit.
      Joseph would have still gone to Egypt, endure process and become prime minister nonetheless must going to Egypt be on the premise of his brothers’ betrayal? </p>
      <br>

      <p>You don’t have to be the source of someone’s pain for the person to learn surrender. Don’t indoctrinate people with grief for them to run to God. Allow God chastise His children by Himself. </p>

      <p>“Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.”
      Galatians 6:10 NKJV.</p>

    content:`
      <p>Decisions and consequences are like the two sides of a coin; you flip one and have the other. One cannot escape decision making. Even indecision makes a decision itself. Decision making is part of life, of necessity; growth. Same with consequences; no one can escape consequences.</p><br>

      <p>Normally, when we hear of informed decision, what comes to mind is a decision that has been thoroughly considered on all fronts.</p>

      <p>You do a risk-benefit assessment and take a decision that will profit you.</p><br>

      <p>In the secular world, there are parameters of assessment, for example, which opportunity offers better remuneration, which prospective partner looks promising, which location presents greener pasture etc.
      These are the cannons of assessment for the mundane.</p><br>

      <p>But it is not the same with the believer. For the believer, informed decision is that which one has been led by the Spirit to do. So no matter the number of attractive options presented to you, the best choice is the one the Holy Spirit leads toward.</p><br>

      <p>You will realize one would be asked to sleep on a choice then come up with the final decision, eg signing a new contract, switching jobs, relocating etc.</p><br>

      <p>There is no need to think through what you are being led to do by the Spirit if it is a good decision or not.</p>

      <p>Every instruction by God is a good advice, thus good decision.

      Thus any step taken in response to God is the right step.Unless you are not sure it is the Spirit of God leading you, then you should wait on the LORD for clarity.</p><br>

      <p>But once you get the clarity that, this is the leading of God, there is no need to have second thoughts, what the Spirit is leading you to, is the informed decision.</p><br>

      <p>Since we cannot escape decision making, we cannot escape reaping the consequences. As long as there is seed time and harvest, God cannot be mocked. We reap the consequences of our inactions, even indecisions. There is no way one can escape consequences. Therefore consider every decision with the spirit. Submit your ways to God and he shall prosper you.</p><br>

      <p>You may be phlegmatic, who may have difficulty in arriving at a decision, a melancholy, very analytic or even a sanguine who may ignore small details, whatever your temperament is, you are first a believer, thus don’t leave God out of your decision-making processes.</p><br>

      <p>God wants to lead you. He will not be silent if you need His opinion about ANYTHING. God always has an opinion, if only you will ask Him. And after you inquire and He leads, do not question it, even if it doesn’t appeal to human logic. Even if it doesn’t look like the best option according to human standards.</p>

      <p>It is not wise to question the one who is wisdom. Do not lean on your own understanding.</p><br>

      <p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.”<br>
      Proverbs 3:5-6NKJV</p><br>

      <p>“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”<br>
      Romans 8:14 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.”<br>
      Jeremiah 29:11 NKJV</p><br>

    author: "Alice Anane Tawiah",
    date: "2025-05-04",
    content: `
      <p>Apostle Arome Osayi has a powerful exhortation titled “ What will you do with the Holy Ghost?”</p><br>
      <p>You should listen, it talks about how the believer makes use of the precious Gift that the Holy Spirit is.</p><br>
      <p>Myles Monroe says when the purpose of anything is not known, abuse is inevitable.</p><br>
      <p>Assuming your father has made you the heir to a Goldmine and you don’t know how valuable Gold is. You will farm on the land instead of mining for Gold.</p><br>
      <p>What will you do with the Holy Ghost? This is a question God can ask us. After giving us such advantage, how will we make use of it?</p><br>
      <p>What will you do with this mistake?, is a question some of us too can ask God.</p><br>
      <p>Beauty for ashes, right?</p><br>
      <p>This is not a burning ruin, this is the ashes of the ruin, the most useless spoil of a destruction. What can possibly come out of an ash? Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Nathaniel will ask, like his friend rightly answered, “come and see”.</p><br>
      <p>John C Maxwel has a book titled, ‘ FAILING FORWARD’. I love it, it talks about how one can use mistakes as stepping stones to purpose. May your mistake minister restoration to others, that you failed forward like John C. Maxwell will say.</p><br>
      <p>I made a mistake, and realizing the gravity of my actions, I attempted to correct it. But I realized the person I stabbed is already dead. Oh my..what can I do now? She is dead already, no matter how sorry I am, she can’t come back to life. And the one who is called resurrection smiled at me. He told me “ It seems you have forgotten my name, I am the resurrection and life “</p><br>
      <p>Through faith, women received their dead back to life but the women didn’t raise the dead themselves, the one who is called resurrection did.</p><br>
      <p>And so resurrection told me, “you can receive her back to life but not by you preforming incessant CPR, just give me the corpse”</p><br>
      <p>And I asked Him, “ I know that all things work together for good, please, how will my murder work for her good? she’s gone as you can see”</p><br>
      <p>Resurrection told me “ come and see”</p><br>
      <p>He took the lifeless body, He took my mistake, He took the ashes of my damage and He entered His incubation chamber.</p><br>
      <p>Give it to Him. Give Him the pain. Give Him the guilt. Give Him the ruins of your mistake. And if the guilt is too much, He can help you get through it. But give Him the burden. And it’s okay to ask “ What will He do with this mistake?”</p><br>
      <p>Well, I don’t have all the answers but I know one, Beauty….i know when we give Him an ash, He gives us petals. He is an expert in turning the most ugliest circumstances into wonders, beauties to behold.</p><br>
      <p>This mistake is woeful, it seems you can’t do anything to redeem it. Oh but He is redeemer of my past. I don’t have to attempt to go back to correct things, I may make matters worse. But, I can hand over the mistake to Him.</p><br>
      <p>We are asking God, what can He possibly do with this irreversible damage you have caused. Can any good thing come out of this mistake if not pain, shame and regret?</p><br>
      <p>Unlike us, God knows the ‘purpose’ of that mistake and He won’t abuse it and so he beckons on us “ come and see”</p><br>
      <p>He knows exactly what He will do  with the mistake.</p><br>
      <p>“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”</p><br>
      <p>Romans 8:28 NKJV</p><br>
      <p>“A bruised reed He will not break, And smoking flax He will not quench; He will bring forth justice for truth.”</p><br>
      <p>Isaiah 42:3 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>The weight of self is the most difficult to shed. When you are your own distraction. When there is a will to be with Him but it seems faint. Now your audience is you, to please you.</p><br>
    <p>But I thought you said you love Him more than anything?</p><br>
    <p>Now when we say we love Him more than anything, externals come to mind, third parties come to mind. But what about me?</p><br>
    <p>Do I love Him more than me?</p><br>
    <p>Do I love Him more than what I want?</p><br>
    <p>I have heard of self-abandonment. Yes..He mentioned that if I want to follow Him, I should deny myself. Now the enemy between me and Him is me. It’s either Him or me.</p><br>
    <p>Wills and assurances..what’s the point of Him giving us will of not to willingly choose Him? He also needs assurance yes, that we choose Him without compulsion. We choose Him without threats.</p><br>
    <p>I can’t love me and love Him. I can’t be enthroned on my heart and say He is my King. Only Him rules. Only His name is Glorified. So I let go of any weight and entanglement, even if the weight is me, that I may win Him.</p><br>

    content: `
    <p>The first thing that came to mind when the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart about this was “WASTING ON PLEASURE”.</p><br>
    <p>One wise man said, if a man loses touch with purpose, He distracts himself with pleasure. This cannot be more true.</p><br>
    <p>The devil…No wonder he is called the old serpent, is very cunning. But thanks be to God the ancient of days, is on our side, always exposing his devices.</p><br>
    <p>The devil is not really interested in you serving Him, so far as you won’t serve the purposes of God. If He can get you to serve yourself, He is good to go.</p><br>
    <p>And He does this with a bait called pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>His manifesto doesn’t applaud his own government, He rather recommends self-government. He prompts you on how much you can be in charge of your own life, how that you deserve that enjoyment, how that you should give yourself a break and sleep, how that just one movie wouldn’t hurt. He convinces you that there is enough time, and that you can use the time at hand to please yourself. He convinces you to put yourself ahead of what God wants you to do. And so the time you are to interceed, you will be surfing the internet, the time you are to read the word, you will be on WhatsApp. Because it is easier and more appealing to the flesh and so we service that one instead of God’s needs.</p><br>
    <p>But…what about our first love?</p><br>
    <p>Love…Love is sweet. Love is warm. Love is life but most importantly, love is demanding. Love comes with responsibility that’s why it’s a choice.</p><br>
    <p>There are times in our love walk with the King that you cannot wait to be in the room alone with Him, where you lavish all that you are on Him. Where every word in His voice sends vibrations to your spines, where He is the only one who can move you. These are beautiful seasons in our walk with Him that when He draws us, it is easy to run after Him. In these seasons, we are not afraid to say there is nothing we won’t give up for Him.</p><br>
    <p>However, there come seasons that the tunes we dance to become silent. Such that the chords we respond to will be the knowing in our hearts. Where conviction will be our only drive. The tunes that served as the wave that swept us to His chambers seemed to have dried out. So we have to willingly push ourselves to His presence.</p><br>
    <p>During this season, the voice of the flesh becomes loud because the tunes of the King’s love song seem to have gone dim. It is during this season that if care is not taken, pleasure will be the new King.</p><br>
    <p>But that is not how love is done. We don’t only love when the sensations are loud. We love even when everywhere is quiet and the chirping of birds have died out.</p><br>
    <p>It is not easy to read the word consistently, and sometimes, it is not sweet to pray. But if we are always looking for sweet before we commit, we will sell ourselves to the colony of pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>And so He asked Peter, do you love me more than these?</p><br>
    <p>Do you love me more than pleasure?</p><br>
    <p>And pleasure can be a person, a movie, even a meal. Do you love Him more than these?</p><br>
    <p>Don’t waste away on pleasure. Don’t be a slave to pleasure, sacrificing your destiny on the altar of fleeting pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>Ever wonder why you no longer feel the burden God gave you? You kept on procrastinating and now another has taken your place. You feel entitled to another chance so you relegate what you can do now to tomorrow because you feel pleasure is more urgent than God’s needs.</p><br>
    <p>Everyone has potential to be great if only you will partner with God instead of pleasure.</p><br>
    <p>Yes, the dopamine rush when you surf the internet is out of this world but what about your commitment to your personal altar? What about your destiny? What about your generation? Most importantly, what about the one you love?</p><br>
    <p>And so He asks, Do you love Him more than the dopamine rush?</p><br>
    <p>This is a wake up call to all of us, let us return to the secret place.</p><br>
    <p>“Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.”<br>
    Revelation 2:4-5 KJV</p><br>
    <p>“He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.”<br>

    content: `
    <p>Regrets… I know we all have regrets.<br>
    Regret can spring from many channels. Predominately, from wrong decisions. We can regret ignoring our intuition, trusting the wrong person, investing in a wrong venture. Mostly, we regret we’ve been victimized by people and circumstances. When people you trust betray you.<br>
    Per the aforementioned circumstances, regret seems inevitable.<br>
    <br>
    
    However, what if you are rather the villain in the story? This is a different ball game altogether. It’s one thing to have regrets because you are the victim of circumstances, it’s another thing to have regrets because you are the perpetrator of evil.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“I killed my sister”…… I used to tell myself this. “How could I? She needed me and if I couldn’t be there for her, I shouldn’t have murdered her”.<br>
    This is me in my lowest moment in life. I was beaten by guilt and I had given up, made the muddy waters my home.<br>
    <br>
    Have you ever made such a terrible mistake such that you write yourself off? Your mistake has become a scar such that whenever any opportunity comes up, you tell yourself you don’t deserve it?<br>
    Past experiences can block present day opportunities, yes. Only if we allow it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let’s talk about Asherman’s syndrome.<br>
    This is a medical term for a scar in the uterus that prevents conception from reaching its full term. This scar may have occurred in the past as a result of a surgical procedure in the womb (D and C) for elective abortion, incomplete miscarriage or retained placenta after delivery. Apart from elective abortion, the conditions that necessitate this procedure are things one does not have control of and must undergo to ensure continuity and safety of life.<br>
    <br>
    Of all the reasons for this procedure, let’s talk about elective abortion. Remember, I said it’s a scar in the womb that prevents pregnancy. Elective abortion is a procedure one willingly opts for. So after your own decision has left you with a forever scar such that future opportunities seem to have been blocked.<br>
    <br>
    So I prefer to synonymize Asherman’s syndrome to the weight of guilt that prevents new beginnings.<br>
    There is a difference between regret and repentance. Regret births guilt whereas repentance births restitution.<br>
    <br>
    Guilt makes you see yourself below how God does. You will feel undeserving of any good thing. It is this scar that prevents future opportunities, future pregnancies such that you miscarry any new conception.</p>
    <br>

    <p>There are indelible marks in the heart.<br>
    Marks that have been infected.<br>
    We attempt debridement, but the more we scrape off the infected flesh, the more we realize amputation is a better option.<br>
    This is because the wound is directing the treatment plan.<br>
    <br>
    But… there is a Physician I know, whose treatment plan is not dependent on the size of the wound of the patient, but His own wound. He is called the Balm of Gilead.<br>
    Through His own wounds, we receive healing.<br>
    If your heart is butchered beyond recovery, He can give you a new heart.<br>
    “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”<br>
    Ezekiel 36:26 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>He told me His recreative healing will take place and those who are willing, He will give a new heart. And not just a new heart, but a new beginning. He will speak life to your paths and decorate your paths with mercy. Your paths will breathe with newness. The past is not as essential as you make it seem. He told me it is not wisdom to hold on to a second when you have eternity ahead of you. What is behind you is just but a second, don’t rob yourself of the vast future ahead of you.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Ever wonder why is it rather the GOODNESS of God that leads to repentance, not His wrath?<br>
    Don’t excuse yourself from Grace because the Perfect One Himself has a different prescription. 
    <br>
    <br>He doesn’t write you off to teach you a lesson, He rather infuses you with overdose of love to bring you back home. That’s why when the world was so depraved with sin, His solution was LOVE.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“For God so loved the world…”<br>
    Sounds familiar?</p>
    <br>

    <p>So you are holding back, not receiving His love and new opportunities He is giving because of guilt. Guilt is weighty. Guilt is very heavy. And most importantly, it’s an indicator of pride. For when God gives you a seat and you say you don’t deserve it, you are proud. Says my Father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah.
    <br>
    <br>
     The LORD has been teaching me about pride. Pride is to set yourself in opposition to God. That’s why He opposes the proud. But the proud sets himself before the LORD first. So if God is saying you are worthy of this Gift and you have a different opinion, you have set yourself in opposition and you are proud. God says you are forgiven and you are refusing to forgive yourself, you are not on the same page with God.<br>
     <br>
    Another thing He told me about pride is that, anyone who is proud will not bend enough to be covered. To be covered by what? His Grace. That’s why He gives Grace to the humble but He resists the proud. He resists the proud in that the proud wants to rub shoulders with Him, not lowly enough to receive Grace. 
    <br>
    <br>You cannot be covered by Grace, you cannot be covered by His love. So you need to stop resisting His love in the name of “I don’t deserve it.” In the name of guilt, you are setting yourself in opposition to God. Mercy…</p>
    <br>

    <p>Guilt will keep you stuck, you cannot fly as the eagle you are. Whereas you belong to the sky, the weight of guilt will cripple you on ground. For no one can fly with a weight.</p>

    <br>
    <p>That’s why He asked us to lay aside every weight so that we will be able to run…</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,”<br>
    Hebrews 12:1 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whatever the weight of that guilt is, you can exchange it for His yoke. His yoke is not as heavy as the guilt. And so He says, come and Rest.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”<br>
    Matthew 11:28-30 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>You don’t have to hold on to that pain. Just allow His gentle touch. And that guilt of a scar that is preventing new conceptions, just like Asherman’s syndrome—He can heal it. One thing about God is that He is the only one who can heal a wound without leaving a scar. There will not be any trace of it. Only if you will allow Him.</p>
    <br>

    <p>And so, He is calling unto the mighty woman within you. Don’t shield her with your old identity. He is calling unto the Apostle in you. Who are you to say you are not worthy? You are not wiser than God. You are the perfectionist, not Him. He is the perfect one. You don’t have to have a clean history to have a beautiful future. Allow God…</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whatever Gold He is calling out of you, don’t question His intelligence. Heaven is waiting on you. Your generation awaits you. Wake up. Shake off the dust. Step out of the darkness of shame. Pick up your mat and walk, General. The cloud of witnesses cheers you on.</p>
    <br>

    <p>If God says I am worthy of forgiveness, then I agree with Him. You should also come into agreement with what Heaven has declared over your life.<br>
    <br>
    The goodness of God leads to repentance, not the wrath of God.<br>
    Because of His mercies, we are not consumed, all of us. No one can outgrow mercy.</p>
    <br>

    <p>You are welcome back Home, Precious one.<br>
    <br>
    By God’s Grace,<br>

      <p>“I’m not going anywhere, I will be here.”<br>
      <br>
      This is what I have been telling Him. This is because my allegiance to Him is being challenged.<br>
      A friend of mine said, every believer will come to a point where it seems one is losing faith, but we must ensure our faith doesn’t fail.<br>
      <br>
      My Father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah says faith failure is worse than heart failure. Even in my struggle of keeping my own faith, I’ve been thinking about this and it can’t be more true, because the just shall live by Faith and without faith, the righteous dies. Abraham was righteous because He had faith, thus the righteous is nought, without faith.</p>
      <br>

      <p>The path of the righteous is as a shining light, yes, it shines brighter and brighter unto a perfect day. Howbeit, on this path are mountains, valleys, crooked paths and rough edges. There are valley seasons and mountain seasons, regardless of whatever season you are in, one thing is sure, your path shines, because His word lights your path.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve been in my valley season, and faith doesn’t make sense, faith doesn’t appeal to reason, yes, but in this season, I was siding with logic and reason. I started to question my ventilator, my life support, my belief system. Everything seemed like a cliché to me. I was dying because I was losing faith, remember, the just shall live by faith.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p><strong>THE COMPANY OF LOVE</strong><br>
      1 Corinthians 13 makes more sense here, it says Love never fails. Even when it seems faith is failing, love will sustain it.<br>
      <br>
      Follow me…</p>
      <br>

      <p>In my darkest moment when I was thinking of the unthinkable, I was doubting the existence of the one who holds existence together. My faith was practically gone, I thought that was it, and the company of love showed up.<br>
      <br>
      I didn’t know one could hotspot on someone’s faith. Like, I’m running out of battery and I needed to key in to someone’s reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      Speaking with a member of the company of love, the idea of ‘hotspotting’ someone’s faith came to mind. Because He was feeding me His faith and I was gaining strength.<br>
      Today, I want to appreciate my company of love.<br>
      <br>
      I was ashamed that I was going through what I am going through. I was angry that, how can I be doubting and questioning God. Then my company showed up and told me to rest, stop beating myself up, I should lie down while they infuse me with love. Because love is the answer to any question of faith.<br>
      <br>
      One such instance, I had to pray with one member, when he called, I told him it was pointless because I don’t believe anyway. He told me to be on the phone and not say anything, just hear him pray and that was life giving.</p>
      <br>

      <p>God has been lavish when it comes to His provision of love, in that He has given me people who will love me well. It is because of them I didn’t lose faith, because when my own faith was failing, their love didn’t fail and I could hear Abbah’s voice through their love.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I want to first of all appreciate one of my greatest Gifts, my mother. I would have said I don’t deserve her but my father in the LORD has made me know when God offers you a seat and you say you don’t deserve it, that’s not humility but pride. So I accept and appreciate the gift of you, Mama Doe. God was so intentional when He gave me you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I appreciate my father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah. I first had the privilege of calling someone Dad because of you. You are right for me. You are the best Abbah could ever give. I love and honor you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>My sister, TillyJoy, you love me to a fault, you feel my pain like it’s yours. You could pluck your eyes for me when I’m struggling to see. I see you, I hear your heart and I appreciate you.</p>
      <br>

      <p>My brother, Prince Israel, I call you the LORD’s. There is nothing you won’t do for me. You will go high and low for me. I love you as much as you do. You are my best gift from God. I love your heart, you are rare.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I used to trivialize the gift of friends so I lost valuable people, irreplaceable. I am not going to make the same mistake again. Friends make the journey easier, they bear your yoke with you, they make the burden lighter.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, I am going to be intentional in appreciating them, I’m going to be mentioning names.</p>

      <p><strong>Shekinah Glory</strong>, you’ve been like a cushion to my life’s storms. When I am afraid and trembling, you’ve been the voice of Abbah, telling me to fear not. You are so wise and beautiful. I am lucky to have you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Theo</strong>, I call you Man of Jesus Christ. I can count on you always. At gun point, when I’m asked to call one person, it would be you. You are always there for me, in and out of season. I can’t thank God enough for you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Kharis</strong>, you are Greatness personified. You know me through and through and you are not ashamed to love me recklessly. You are unconventional, sacrificial and beautiful. Thank you for you. You are Gold.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Jedi</strong>, my brother. You are comfort, you are peace, you are full of life. You fit in so well and you do the brother role perfectly. Thank you for loving me. I am honored.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Percy</strong>, thank you for hearing me when I can’t find my voice. You can read my heart when my voice fails. Thank you for being here. I’m grateful for you.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Becky</strong>, thank you for being honest, straightforward and wise. Thank you for having my back. You care and I appreciate it.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Maame K</strong>, you are sweet as your name. My sweet Ama. You challenge me. You make me want to be better. You are beautiful and even more beautiful at heart. I’m glad that I am your best friend. I love you so much.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Shofar</strong>, my sister in destiny. You are very prompt and intentional about me. Thank you for hearing me out when I need you. You shine so bright and your light blesses my world.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Diana</strong>, it’s been more than a decade and you are still here, loving on me. Your love is true. Your love has stood the test of time. I know I mean a lot to you and you are also archived in my heart.</p>
      <br>

      <p>I am able to tell Abbah that I will be here, I am not leaving because these people did not leave me when I betrayed my own self, when I was sabotaging myself they restrained me by their love. When I couldn’t pray, they were praying for me. And because of them, I have a reason to live and fulfill purpose.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Happy birthday to me, I am because of you.</strong></p>
      <br>

    <p>He who waters shall be watered. This principle works so much for me. When I share myself, I increase the more. And that is why I am going to be open and vulnerable in this piece. And just like you, I hope I am as blessed by the end of this piece.</p>

    <p>May Jesus be our light and life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I found myself in a vicious cycle. Whenever I hear “out of Egypt forever,” my heart leaps.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Like, I’ve longed for the entanglements of the flesh that kept me in Egypt to loose.</p>

    <p>Lust was my number one enemy. I am a heart person. I long for affection and closeness. Mostly, I desire to express my fondness through harmless touches, male and female alike.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Same way, I love intimacy. Intimacy is good but it can be corrupted. So I would find myself in this web. But finally, I won the battle against lust. I let go of all the triggers. If it is a relationship that created that ambience for lust to thrive, I gave it up.</p>
    <br>
   

    <p><strong>KAIROS MOMENTS</strong></p>

    <p>Now I had realized some things about seasons. It seemed whenever I am at the verge of breakthrough, I would mess up and lose that opportunity. These are sponsored by time-sensitive demonic watchers. Just like the man by the pool of Bethesda, there are kairos moments that angels come to stir up waters. Such destiny-altering moments require promptness, sensitivity at its peak, and utmost alignment — else one will remain stagnant while prophecies hang over your shoulders.</p>
    <br>

    <p>So realizing this, I decided to honor my destiny by sitting up. I fought against lust when it came at that time of the month. At last, I won.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I knew it. I saw it. I saw it fleeing from me. I knew it was done.</p>

    <p><em>“Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.”</em><br>
    James 4:7 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>I thought that was it — that which used to be a stumbling block had been done away with. I saw glimpses of glory. I went back to the chambers of the King. I dined with Him. I danced for Him. He is worthy of my heart, my all. I was now expecting the promise — nothing would stand in the way now.</p>
    <br>

    <p>But…</p>

    <p>Another enemy surfaced: offense. After I realized the warfare I was in, I asked myself why I am constantly fighting these frontline demons — lust, offense, pride, fear, etc.</p>
    <br>

    <p>This time round, I found myself battling with offense (unforgiveness). I had been betrayed by my best friend, and I couldn’t reason my way into forgiveness. Because I knew I could never do the same to him. Honor would not permit me to. Love would not permit me. Compassion would not permit me. So how could he?</p>
    <br>

    <p>I contemplated forgiveness while I kept on asking: Why? Why did he? So, I felt unforgiveness was my leverage over him. If I don’t forgive, it will mean he still owes me and he’s caught within my claws. I wanted to forgive. At the same time, I didn’t want to.</p>
    <br>

    <p>One day, I woke up with anger in my heart, coupled with an ache. I was hurt and bruised, still contemplating forgiveness, and then the gentle whispers of the Helper came through…</p>
    <br>

    <p>He asked rhetorically, “Do you know you are under attack?”</p>
    <br>

    <p>That question opened my eyes to all that was happening around me. The devil was trying to short-circuit the promise I had been waiting for, by using offense — his bait. I fell for it. Lust was gone. Now, he was using offense. That being realized, I prayed and released whoever I needed to release — and consequently, released myself from the prison of offense. Then the sweet Holy Spirit continued…</p>
    <br>

    <p>“You cannot reason your way into forgiveness, neither can you lessen the weight of guilt through reason. Reasoning makes it worse. It buttresses why you should not let it go. But just as it didn’t make sense when God decided to die for you, so does forgiving the unforgivable. God was unreasonably merciful, unreasonably forgiving, unreasonably gracious. He saw that it was your fault — truly He did see — but He forgave you.”</p>
    <br>

    <p>Then I forgave them. And I forgave me. I felt light. Handcuffs removed. I am free to access my lot.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Wow!</p>
    <br>

    <p>Offense gone. Gone for good. Satan does not have anything with me anymore, and I decided that I will be on guard by guarding my heart. I will not be ignorant of the devices of the enemy.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.”</em><br>
    2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>Whenever anything ungodly attempts to enter my heart, I arrest it at the gate. I man the gate of my heart. It is my responsibility.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.”</em><br>
    Proverbs 4:23 NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>So now, I am on the watch for any scheme of the enemy. It will not catch me at the blind side — not anymore.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Then, boredom set in…</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>LETHARGY WHEN BUSINESS IS REQUIRED</strong></p>

    <p>I had been praying all manner of prayers, fasted all kinds of fasting for this promise. Now, by the grace of God, I had bypassed time-sensitive bumps that could lead to detours. Here it was — at hand, the promise. Within arm’s reach. And what did I do?</p>
    <br>

    <p>No, I didn’t sleep. Neither did I default into the old ways. I got distracted. I was not ensnared by sin this time — I was trapped by apathy.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Prayer became so hard. My mouth became heavy. All I could do was entertain myself with intellectual movies and maybe games. They’re not sinful, right? But I was missing out on kairos — the season I had been waiting for.</p>
    <br>

    <p>“Having done all to stand, stand.”</p>

    <p>If all the machinations of the devil fail, he will use you against you. That’s what he did with me.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I felt I needed a break from God. Funny, right?</p>

    <p>I invested my emotions to pray all these prayers, do all He asked me, and the wait was killing me. So I said, “You know what? Let me take a break. I will only watch movies.”</p>
    <br>

    <p>I termed it self-care. Interestingly, that was when the promise arrived. He knocked and knocked — my order was in — but I was engrossed in the movies, engrossed with self-care. Engrossed, paying attention to me. I really did pay.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore…”</em><br>
    Ephesians 6:13–14a NKJV</p>
    <br>

    <p>When you read from the first verse of the chapter, Apostle Paul addresses various kinds of relationships. He addresses offense and prescribes love.</p>
    <br>

    <p>So after one has fought offense and the likes — just like I did — we must still STAND.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Having done all to stand, stand again.</strong></p>

    <p>Perry Stone authored a book I’m drawn to: *“There is a Crack in Your Armor.”*</p>

    <p>There are things that do not directly come against us, but weaken our resolve.</p>
    <br>

    <p>My armor was in place. I wasn’t harboring offense, lust, or anything. But there was a crack. I had lost focus.</p>

    <p>The enemy may offer you water and a tent to rest from the race.</p>
    <br>

    <p><em>“...and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,”</em><br>
    Hebrews 12:1c NKJV</p>

    <p>That is what he offered me. I took a break from God. But the race requires steady, consistent progress. Speed is not necessary. Steadiness is. And in this race, we don’t take breaks. No, we don’t.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>HOW TO RECOGNIZE FERTILE SEASONS</strong></p>

    <p>Fertile seasons don’t just surface. They represent years of spiritual investment — prayers, seed sowing, fasting in response to God’s instructions.</p>
    <br>

    <p>These are fruitful seasons where the least effort brings huge results. They come after seasons of dry toiling. You don’t have to toil anymore — just one push and it’s done.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Like Elijah praying for rain — and no sign — then that one last word of prayer released the rain. A fertile season is the culmination of all previous efforts.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Ironically, it’s during these seasons that it’s hardest to open your mouth. That one last push becomes the heaviest. You could pray for hours during dry seasons, but now… you can’t whisper a word. That’s lethargy in a fertile season.</p>
    <br>

    <p>When you feel inertia and apathy in prayer, you may be in your fertile season. Attractive distractions will come. When this happens — call for reinforcement. A friend. An online service. Anything. Just speak that one word. That’s all it takes to release the rain.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Having done all to stand in dry seasons — STAND in your fertile season.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>PRAYER</strong></p>

    <p>I pray for you, that you will not become lethargic in your fertile season. That you will be sensitive enough to recognize your kairos.</p>
    <br>

    <p>And if you have missed out on a fertile season, I pray for mercy for restoration.</p>
    <br>

    <p>God can repeat seasons by His mercies.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I pray this write-up accomplishes God’s desire in our lives, in Jesus’ name.</p>
    <br>

    <p>If you are blessed, kindly leave a comment. It encourages me.</p>

      <p>There is a friend of mine, I haven’t met a man so meek.</p><br>

      <p>It’s one thing to admire someone from a distance, it’s another thing to get so close and still admire even more.</p><br>

      <p>They say proximity reveals flaws, I say proximity only magnifies whatever there is.</p><br>

      <p>In microscopy, focusing a lense will give a better view of whatever object you want to examine. The thing may be minute from a distance but focusing a lens with the right magnification gives you the view you need.</p><br>

      <p>So proximity doesn’t necessarily reveal flaws, it reveals details, even the minutest ones that can easily be ignored by a distant admirer.</p><br>

      <p>This friend I am talking about, when I got closer, I was challenged.</p><br>

      <p>Exposure does a lot to the naive you know. Depending on ones state of heart, how teachable one can be, exposure can do a lot.</p><br>

      <p>Exposure may challenge one to do better</p><br>

      <p>Exposure may intimidate others</p><br>

      <p>Exposure may embarrass others</p><br>

      <p>Whatever exposure does to you depends on your state of heart.</p><br>

      <p>When I met this friend of mine, that exposure provoked me, not in a good way at first. It triggered my insecurities and I felt He was too good to be true. How patient He is, How MEEK he is. Even when it was obvious that people were taking advantage of His generosity because He is a really great giver. I will point out people’s ulterior motives to exploit his generosity thinking he may be naive to notice, He will smile at me and tell me “ I know Alice, but as long as I have, I will continue to give”</p><br>

      <p>This baffled me. This and many other things I learned from Him. I had read about the man Jesus, but from the people I have encountered so far in little years on earth, He is the person that is closest to the character of Jesus, so I call Him Man of Jesus Christ.</p><br>

      <p>They say we are the Bible the world read. One’s character can convert unbelievers so we should let our light shine before men.</p><br>

      <p>Normally, when this is mentioned, we think of unbelievers. But have you thought of struggling believers?</p><br>

      <p>Apart from having a great report before unbelievers, have you thought about how you inspire and encourage other Christians to be better?</p><br>

      <p>This evening, after a stressful day after work and other personal rounds, getting home, I felt I needed to reward myself with my favorite Netflix series “ The Good Doctor”</p><br>

      <p>I had not read my Bible today and when I picked my phone “ I asked myself, will sister S do this?”</p><br>

      <p>This is a sister I admire from church. She challenges me, she inspires me. I knew the answer is No. Then I quickly sat up and did the needful.</p><br>

      <p>What am I saying is that, people have been praying for an encounter, that the word comes alive to them, and you are the answer to their cry.</p><br>

      <p>The struggling believer may not get mysteries and “reve” when He reads the Bible but He sees YOU.</p><br>

      <p>People may not have met Jesus when He walked on the face of the earth, neither have they had a face-to-face encounter with Him but they see YOU.</p><br>

      <p>Are you that friend?</p><br>

      <p>Are you the friend that just the thought of you challenges people to sit up?</p><br>

      <p>Maybe its time to stop being selfish, people are looking up to you. You are a custodian, you came as an answer to many cries. Take your post.</p><br>

      <p>There are invisible eyes looking at you for hope, that one can take a stand for Jesus, that Purity is Possible, and that one can win by righteousness.</p><br>

      <p>Maybe the cloud of witnesses are not just in the clouds, some are here in the Church, cheering you on. Waiting on your win so that they will believe it is also possible for them.</p><br>

      <p>Because of these great cloud of witnesses, we will run with endurance and not be complacent, till our bodies look like Jesus, our breath smells Jesus, till Jesus is proclaimed on the rooftop.</p><br>

      <p>And since we have received such a great ministry, WE FAINT NOT.</p><br>

      <p>Be that friend.</p><br>

      <p>“and let us consider [thoughtfully] how we may encourage one another to love and to do good deeds,”</p><br>

      <p>Hebrews 10:24 AMP</p><br>

      <p>“Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,”</p><br>

      <p>Hebrews 12:1 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>Have you admired a preacher ministering before? Our Jesus Glorifies and He decorates His people with beauty, so its not surprising to admire his servants.</p><br>

      <p>You will see a man of God ministering and you can’t but admire the decorum. From the Excellency in presentation to the very beautiful suit He is wearing. God is excellent and He must be communicated excellently.</p><br>

      <p>Have you also encountered a preacher with poor countenance, from the appearance to presentation such that it affects the reception regardless of the anointing behind the ministration?</p><br>

      <p>This highlights the beauty of excellence and details. If excellence can affect reception then whatever work that must be put to achieve it is worth it. Excellence is not achieved on a silver platter. Consistent work is invested to achieve it. Sometimes, it requires collaborative input.</p><br>

      <p>Normally when we are applauding an excellent man, we focus just on Him. Noone really considers his support system. Men who toil behind the scenes in collaboration with Him to produce the excellence that is admired.</p><br>

      <p>Well… let’s focus on the first scenario, the one with the beautiful suit. When you witness such, do you think about the tailor who made the suit? Or the one who ironed it nicely?</p><br>

      <p>That is human nature, we only recognize what is outdoored, the flamboyance and ornateness, we don’t really pay attention to the work that was invested or whatever happened behind the scene, we only celebrate the results.</p><br>

      <p>But God is not like that. He doesn’t just celebrate results, He also acknowledges process. That is why to God, the means is as important as the end. You can’t give God anything and He will ignore how the thing is made, the heart behind it. God is that deep, He is not superficial like humans.</p><br>

      <p>This is to our advantage because due to this attribute of God, everyone who plays any part is rewarded and not just those in the spotlight. The tailor who made the beautiful suit the man of God is wearing is seen by God and He is a rewarder.</p><br>

      <p>Have you ever come to church and wondered who cleaned the chair you are sitting on? We only celebrate the seen and do not concern ourselves with the faceless and nameless people whose sacrifices have made the service a success but God sees.</p><br>

      <p>“And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it.” Genesis 18:7 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>A young man…</p><br>

      <p>We don’t get to know His name. But He played a very crucial role. God will be not unfair to only acknowledge the one who brought the food. Even though it was at Abraham’s command, it takes a village.</p><br>

      <p>From this text, we don’t even get the name of the young man who killed the sheep, but God knows. And it isn’t only Abraham and Sarah who will be blessed, at the set time when God visits them with His reward, He will not be left behind. God is not unjust.</p><br>

      <p>“For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.” Hebrews 6:10 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>This is to encourage someone out there. To my Brethren who go to sweep and mop church auditorium. To those who run incessant errands for men of God. To those who intercede for them in secret. To those who simply share a link or invite someone to church. God sees them all, He will reward everyone accordingly.</p><br>

      <p>He is not just God of the spotlight, He is also God of behind the scenes.</p><br>

      <p>Same way, no matter how great of a mandate one carries, one needs people who will believe in Him and help herald it. Every Paul needs a Timothy.</p><br>

      <p>May God help us to remain faithful even if we are not celebrated by Men.</p><br>
      <br>

      <p>I know we are familiar with the story of the fig tree. The tree that looked so green that it deceived even Jesus, that it might as well have so much fruit.</p><br>

      <p>If you have fallen for the deception of a fig tree, don’t beat yourself up because even Jesus fell for it.</p><br>

      <p>The title of today’s blog may sound intriguing because love from 1 Corinthians 13 doesn’t break. Wholesome love makes one whole, it heals, it binds. And love is wholesome so what broke you?</p><br>

      <p>Well.. We may have fallen for the deception of what looks like but not exactly. What looks like the original but not.</p><br>

      <p>There is a lady I am profoundly drawn to. I came across her reel and she briefly said, the first time she loved, the love broke her. So she coiled into Abbah’s arms with the little pieces of her heart and made a vow that love will no longer make a fool of her and if anyone will tell her He loves her, she will plaster a vacant smile across her face, pour out an empty gratitude and gift them her absence.</p><br>

      <p>I smiled.</p><br>

      <p>I smiled out of empathy because I know how it feels to be broken by love.</p><br>

      <p>My first attempt at love left me in pieces, sometimes when I recall I burst into laughter, even now.</p><br>

      <p>The second attempt looked like a haven, like the fig tree, it looked promising until I got close. What promised me safety now turned to murder grounds. The murder of my heart and my very life.</p><br>

      <p>It left me so shuttered that I became a walking corpse, I wouldn’t feel my body and each night I go to bed, I whispered to Abbah, “Let this be the last night, I don’t want to see the day”</p><br>

      <p>I’m the one writing now so yeah, I didn’t die.  
      Love…..Love</p><br>

      <p>I have learnt that love can only be safe if it’s in its right elements.</p><br>

      <p>Jesus said if you love me, obey my commandment.</p><br>

      <p>Jesus had been speaking of His love for us, but when it came to our love for Him, it was coupled with instructions, conditions. When He asked Peter if He loves Him, He attached an instruction; tend my sheep. It means one cannot trust any human love until these conditions are met or unless it's in the context of OBEDIENCE.</p><br>

      <p>I know everyone here has a peculiar walk with Jesus, so I am addressing such audience. People who are consecrated and the voice of Jesus is the big deal in their lives.</p><br>

      <p>And in effect, I know we won’t be unequally yoked, as in love someone who isn’t a believer or isn’t at par in consecration.</p><br>

      <p>So I am not talking about loving an unbeliever or someone who doesn’t speak our language of consecration.</p><br>

      <p>I am talking about loving someone who ticks all the boxes in our sight, a fig tree let’s say.</p><br>

      <p>Now that we have established that the person we may be drawn to is a lover of Jesus just like us, why would loving a brother or sister break us?</p><br>
      <br>

      <p>OBEDIENCE</p><br>

      <p>Obedience is a guardrail not a restrictive fence. For He who breaks the fence, a serpent will bite. It means whatever that is out there, you are being protected from and you are not missing out on anything if you don’t get to experience it.</p><br>

      <p>Sometimes, someone may be the ‘will of God’ for you but the timing may be wrong. You may go ahead of God. I know someone who received an instruction to date at 23 year, He did at 21 to the same person and it failed miserably. We don’t miss out on God’s will only when we don’t get to be with them but we can also miss out on God’s will when we be with them at the wrong time. God prepares before placement so that you don’t go and meet His will in ruins. You will not enjoy it. It will be like a fig tree.</p><br>

      <p>So if you really want to enjoy love, align with God. Seek His face thoroughly and have a willing heart to obey no matter what His answer is.</p><br>

      <p>Also, don’t trust anyone more than the voice of God. Sometimes people look so safe and we may not understand why God will ask us to stay away from them, but trust. Trust God more than anyone, more than how harmless people may seem.</p><br>

      <p>And if you are asked to let Lot go, it may be difficult and inconveniencing, but a wise man once said “if you think obedience is expensive, try disobedience.”</p><br>

      <p>Trust me, disobedience is that costly. Please obey.</p><br>
      <br>

      <p><strong>VIOLATION OF PRINCIPLES</strong></p><br>

      <p>My father in the LORD, Apostle Joseph Mintah says, the foundation of a godly relationship is purity, interdependence and freewill. Any relationship that violates these principles will break you.</p><br>

      <p>1. <strong>Purity</strong>; Love will not defile you. Love will honor and protect you. A love that breaks is not just love that eventually leaves you but love that raids you of virtue. Love should build and not destroy. True love should be willing to wait, true love upholds your dignity.</p><br>

      <p>2. <strong>Interdependence</strong>; The hallmark of a healthy relationship is interdependence. Not dependence or independence. You need each other in a healthy way not throwing your weight on one another, nor overburdening one another with our weight. In a healthy relationship, there should be emotional regulation and no one should be responsible for one's emotions. Relationship should service the needs of both parties without draining each other.</p><br>

      <p>3. <strong>Freewill</strong>; One should wholeheartedly want to be in a relationship with you. No one should be cajoled into a relationship with “God said you are my wife”. No one should be compelled to be or remain in a relationship with one by using emotional blackmail.</p><br>
      <br>

      <p><strong>HEAL BEFORE YOU DEAL</strong></p><br>

      <p>This is a copied statement from Ps Kingsley Okonkwo.</p><br>

      <p>Many people carry trauma, unhealed hurts, and unmet needs of the soul into a relationship and they end up bleeding on someone who didn’t wound them. Such a relationship will be dysfunctional and will leave you more broken and the cycle of pain will continue if care is not taken. Some people need to take a break from relationships and allow the Holy Spirit to do deep work of healing in them. Else insecurity will affect your reception of love, you cannot accept sincere love and you cannot recognise sincere love. You may find yourself in a vicious cycle of toxic relationships.</p><br>

      <p>Take note.</p><br>

      <p>If these things are not in place, the most genuine person may come off as a fig tree.</p><br>

      <p>So the fig tree doesn’t just connote an insincere person, but wrong conditions (e.g.; timing). You remember I mentioned pure love comes with conditions that are instructions from God e.g. “go ahead”. A person may be sincere and all, but if after seeking God’s face, you don’t get a yes and you still lean on your own understanding, you will meet a fig tree.</p><br>

      <p>Don’t take a step without a big yes from God, it will break you. He sees the end from the beginning, don’t be with any “good” person God cannot vouch for. It’s not every good person that is good for you.</p><br>

      <p>And be in step with the Spirit so that the Holy Spirit can update you in case their heart changes towards you and be quick to obey when He does.</p><br>

      <p>This will be easier if we don’t form idols in our hearts with them.</p><br>
      <br>

      <p><strong>A Call To Trust His Voice</strong></p><br>

      <p>Let us come to the realization that HIS voice is worthy of our trust. And He is not a killjoy. He made love and He wants us to enjoy safe and wholesome love but we must trust Him. A very good friend of mine loves saying this “For He whose name is love will send the best, but faith must have a deeper rest.”</p><br>

      <p>Faith goes with obedience, rest that He will give you a good and perfect gift so don’t be afraid to let Lot go.</p><br>

      <p>Let healing streams flow out of this piece and let the broken receive wholeness. To the broken, I send my love and hugs and I come to announce that joy is coming. But this time around, we are doing it with Jesus. We are not going till He says so no matter how safe the prospect looks.</p><br>

      <p>Grace to trust and obey.</p><br>

      <p>God bless you.</p><br>

    <p>In 2020, the Holy Spirit ran a series on Mercy and Grace with me. I got to understand the peculiarities of these divine commodities.</p><br>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Mercy.</strong></p><br>

    <p>He told me mercy is a universal currency in the realm of the Spirit, you can use it to buy ANYTHING from God. He also told me, Mercy is the only attribute of God that speaks of His sovereignty. Like Mercy and Sovereignty are twins. It is only mercy that spells out how God cannot be bound by any restrictions, HE WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM HE DELIGHTS TO, HE CAN PARDON WHOM HE DECIDES and who can question Him?</p><br>

    <p>“For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.”<br>Romans 9:15 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>God is just, and He has set systems into place as boundary and standard in the affairs of the sundry. He rules in the affairs of men with these precepts and even in the unseen, He remains just adhering to laws He has set into place. But in the provision of Mercy, these can be overlooked to favor one.</p><br>

    <p>“….Mercy triumphs over judgment.”<br>James 2:13b NKJV</p><br>

    <p>Mercy always gives birth to favor. Mercy always gives birth to speed. Mercy can instruct time, such that chronos can become Kairos; set time.</p><br>

    <p>“You will arise and have mercy on Zion; For the time to favour her, Yes, the set time, has come.”<br>Psalms 102:13 NKJV</p><br>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Grace.</strong></p><br>

    <p>On Grace, I learnt that it is the most abundant commodity for the believer. It so sufficient yet abundant. It exceeds the believers needs. Whenever God calls the believer unto an assignment He gives more Grace than the Person requires for the assignment, hence “ Grace is always greater than the price of the calling”. If there is any allocation in God that the believer can feel entitled to, it is Grace. It’s like it is your right. Even the throne is called Grace and the first contact the believer makes when we become saved is Grace.</p><br>

    <p>But Grace and Mercy are not the same. One cannot presume on mercy. We MAY obtain mercy but we WILL find Grace for Help. God decides to show mercy, We find Grace.</p><br>

    <p>“Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”<br>Hebrews 4:16 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>So permit me to say that Mercy is more powerful than Grace. But acquisition of Grace is more certain.</p><br>

    <p>Now, despite the abundance of Grace. It has a Grace period; thus expiry date. As a writer, I have witnessed this so many times. There are seasons when instructions come and Grace to obey accompanies these instructions. Though the instructions may linger, Grace will not. Thus, if you do not obey promptly, it will be very difficult to do so later.</p><br>

    <p>There are times I feel the inspiration to write on a particular topic, I will postpone it to later, only for later to come and I feel so dry and no words will flow. What happened to the Grace? That ease, that enablement to do it has left…</p><br>
    <br>

    <p><strong>A Call for Prompt Obedience</strong></p><br>

    <p>God is telling you something now, the Grace for that thing is now, it is now that it is easier to obey, the more you delay the more it will become difficult and the more your heart will be hardened with excuses.</p><br>

    <p>“again He designates a certain day, saying in David, “Today,” after such a long time, as it has been said: “Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts.”<br>Hebrews 4:7 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>When God gave Abraham the Instruction to offer Isaac, the Bible says He arose at dawn outrightly to execute it. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t difficult for Him, but it would have been more difficult if He had said He wants to spend a week more with His beloved son before He releases Him to the LORD.</p><br>

    <p>“So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.”<br>Genesis 22:3 NKJV</p><br>

    <p>This is a call to instant obedience. I am not saying as soon as you hear any voice then you set off like a tornado. No, you can inquire for clarity before launching. But you know the voice of God. You know it. His sheep knows His voice and you’re His. You know when you are sure it’s His voice but you want to linger with the excuse that you want to make sure its His voice. Don’t deny His voice. This is a call to prompt and thorough obedience, before Grace fades out. There will always be a valid reason to linger, but it is now that you’re hearing His voice. Do not harden your heart. His voice requires your prompt response.</p><br>

    <p>And in your sincerity of hearts, if you attempt anything with the intention of obeying God and it turns out it was your mind, God still counts it as obedience, He will honour it. It is better to obey and find out it was not God than to linger and find out later it was God.</p><br>

    <p>God have mercy on us.</p><br>

      <p>I had heard so much about Joyce Meyer, the highlight being how she was molested by her own father.</p><br>
      <p>However, on this particular day, listening to her, I heard something new.</p><br>

      <p>SHE HAD SURVIVED BREAST CANCER. My jaw dropped in shock. In another message, she made mention of how her biological brother who used to be a drug addict committed suicide. I was like this Woman has indeed been through a lot.</p><br>

      <p>I mean she came from a very toxic background, imagine being molested in an environment you were supposed to feel safe. Her Mum knew but acted ignorant. Where else does she run to? She married later on and the story wasn’t different. The marriage ended and misery turned her into a smoke addict. Tragic isn’t it?</p><br>

      <p>I was thinking about her story, the family history of incest, suicide, addiction to hard drugs, emotional torture and yet look at her! I used to fuss over my own situation. That my background is too far deep into iniquity I felt I needed to drink the entire ocean to be completely delivered. I felt I came from a dysfunctional background so my trauma responses should be tolerated but I looked at Joyce Meyer and I asked myself, what is my excuse?</p><br>

      <p>Even if your mum is a fetish priestess, it will interest you to know that it’s too easy for you to walk in total freedom. You were married to a river? A throne? Apostle James Kawalya was born in a shrine, was breast-fed by a snake, was into homosexuality, He was a hard-core assassin with no iota of compassion but guess what? He is now an Apostle of the almighty God, raiding hell.</p><br>

      <p>What then is your situation? You were born in hell? You are a product of incest or you haven’t seen a holy matrimony in your family before? It will interest you to know that it is not too deep for reach.</p><br>

      <p>You come from a demonic background, the devil is so wicked but guess what? God is more kind! The devil hates you so much, but God loves you more than the devil hates you! Let the devil do all his gimmicks, the Spirit of the LORD ALWAYS lift up a standard against him!</p><br>

      <p>“……..When the enemy comes in like a flood, The Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.”<br>Isaiah 59:19b NKJV</p><br>

      <p>Let the host of hell surround you in attempt to eat your flesh, you will not be afraid, even in this you will be confident. Why? Because perfect love casts out fear. We can confidently trust his love therefore we have boldness in judgment.</p><br>

      <p>“When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh, My enemies and foes, They stumbled and fell. Though an army may encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war may rise against me, In this I will be confident.”<br>Psalms 27:2-3 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.”</p><br>

      <p>“Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.”<br>I John 4:18,17 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>Jesus did such a deep work. His intestines were gushing out, he was disfigured after the scourge by the pillar and after that, He was made to carry a 300kg crossbeam to how many miles naked? And after all these, it is still not enough? You have no score to settle. It is done He said. Love made Him do that for you, and there is no wall He won’t kick down for you. There is no darkness He won’t light and come for you. You are not too far for touch. His love can reach you.</p><br>

      <p>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.”<br>Romans 8:32-34 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>“having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.”<br>Colossians 2:14-15 NKJV</p><br>

      <p>You can be free from bondage, brokenness, mental torture, low self esteem, sickness and oh, you will marry so well!</p><br>

      <p>Please make time and watch the Passion of Christ, this time round, by the spirit.</p><br>

      <p>Be free.</p><br>
